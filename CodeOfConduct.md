## Code of Conduct -  BigDataViewer and Imglib2 software projects 

### Introduction
This code of conduct pertains to all platforms overseen by the projects Imglib2 and BigDataViewer, encompassing both public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, webpages,wikis, blogs, image.sc, zulip, X (Twitter), and other communication channels employed by our community. Any events linked to our community is strongly encouraged to adopt a code of conduct akin to this one. 

All participants within this community, whether in formal or informal capacities, or those associating themselves with the project in any project-related engagements, are expected to adhere to this code of conduct. This holds true particularly when representing the project in any capacity.

While this code isn't exhaustive, it encapsulates our collective perception of a cooperative and shared environment with common objectives. We encourage the observance of this code not only in its literal interpretation but also in its underlying spirit, fostering a welcoming and productive atmosphere that enhances the wider community.

### Specific Guidelines
We aim to:

Foster Openness: We welcome all individuals to engage in our community. Public communication avenues are preferred for project-related communications, except when addressing sensitive matters. This principle extends to queries or support requests – public inquiries are not only more likely to receive responses but also facilitate the detection and correction of inadvertent errors.

Cultivate Empathy: We approach conflicts with empathy, hospitality, friendliness, and patience. Our intention is to collaboratively address disputes while assuming positive motives. While occasional frustration may arise, it is essential that frustration doesn't manifest as personal attacks. A productive community is one in which all members feel secure and respected.

Promote Collaboration: Our contributions serve others, and conversely, we depend on others' work. When we create something for the project's betterment, we're willing to elucidate its functioning to empower others to build upon it. Our choices impact users and colleagues, prompting us to consider consequences conscientiously.

Encourage Inquiry: No one possesses all knowledge. Asking questions early prevents future issues, and while we may direct queries to appropriate platforms, we commit to responsiveness and assistance.

Uphold Diversity: This open source project celebrates and welcomes all contributors. Our goal is to foster an inclusive environment that accommodates diverse backgrounds and identities, striving to treat everyone with kindness, even when accommodating preferences may prove challenging.

Mindful Communication: Our dialogue is marked by thoughtfulness and respect, with each of us taking responsibility for our words. Kindness prevails, and disparaging remarks are discouraged. Harassment and exclusionary behavior, including but not limited to violent threats, discriminatory language, explicit or violent content, and breaches of privacy, are strictly prohibited.

Reporting Process: Recognizing that online communication can devolve into abuse, we approach breaches with understanding. Deliberate infractions should be reported to the Code of Conduct committee. For potential unintentional breaches, individuals may either privately point out the Code of Conduct or report directly to the committee or seek advice.
To report issues, contact the Code of Conduct Committee at BDV&Imglib2-conduct@gmail.com, which comprises:

- Tobias 
- Stephan
- Stephan
- Vladimir 
- Nils ?

In the case of conflicts of interest, reports can alternatively be made to:

- Pavel, Nils? 


### Enforcement and Incident Resolution
This section summarizes crucial points; refer to "BDV&Imglib2 Code of Conduct - How to follow up on a report" for comprehensive details.
All complaints will be investigated and addressed. The Code of Conduct Committee, along with the BDV&Imglib2 Steering Committee if applicable, will maintain the reporter's confidentiality and treat complaints as private (unless otherwise agreed by the reporter).

In case of severe and obvious breaches, like personal threats, immediate disconnection from communication channels will occur (see the manual for specifics).

For breaches not of severe nature, the process includes:
- Acknowledgment of the report
- Constructive dialogue/feedback
- Mediation if needed and agreed upon
- Transparent decision by the Code of Conduct Committee

Emphasizing promptness and fairness, reports will be addressed as soon as possible, likely within 72 hours.
